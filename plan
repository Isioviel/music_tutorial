Lesson 1:
  Music: Basic scale middle C up 1 octave. Exercise: Play back down to middle C.
  Python: Instantiating objects (notes), basic lists.

Lesson 2:
  Music: Basic scale middle C up 2 octaves, quavers. Exercise: Play back down to middle C,
         at double speed (semiquavers?).
  Python: Loops and extra (named) parameters instantiating objects).

Lesson 3:
  Music: Meet Blue Danube, and then make it a bit more efficient. Exercise: Convert the left
         hand to use methods.
  Python: Introduction to methods.

# Improve the plan, figure out what python to introduce. List comprehensions are nice, let's
# use more of those!

# Make the score have a composer and title set

# Make a mini-lib to remove the complexity from the lessons (pgzero approach-
# make each lesson have as little outside what it needs as possible
